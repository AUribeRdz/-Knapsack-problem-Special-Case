# Efficient Allocation Problem Statement: Filling 10 Backpacks with 20 different size boxes might seem a common task BUT different variables have to be considered to achieve this. What is an efficient allocation of these 20 boxes into the available backpacks?
# Hints:
# 1) Box type: assume type A and type B
# 2) Box size: they are not the same
# 3) Backpack capacity: They are not the same
# 4) Box timming: Boxes at the end of the truck might be a better fit
